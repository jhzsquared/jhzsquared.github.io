Hi, I'm a Reliability Engineering PhD Student at the University of Maryland. I am advised by Professor [Michel Cukier](https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/523/Michel-Cukier).

My research focuses on model transparency and measuring the social biases within language models for low resource communities. I am also interested in research on NLP for Positive Impact and AI ethics. I am currently partnering with gun violence researchers at [PROGRESS](https://bsos.umd.edu/academics-research/prevent-gun-violence-research-empowerment-strategies-solutions) through Professor [Joseph Richardson, Jr.](https://aaas.umd.edu/facultyprofile/richardson-jr./joseph).

I obtained my M.S. in Operations Research from MIT in 2019, and my B.S. in Operations Research and Chinese from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 2017. I was an Active Duty Army Officer from 2017-2025.

My full CV is available upon request.

## Fun Facts

<br />
I love a bit of pain with (elevation) gain: mountain biking, skiing, and trail running. But on quieter days, you can find me playing piano, reading, and gardening.
