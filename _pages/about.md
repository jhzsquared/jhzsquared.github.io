Hi, I'm a Reliability Engineering PhD Student at the University of Maryland. I am advised by Professor [Michel Cukier](https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/523/Michel-Cukier).

My research focuses on the reliability of machine learning models, with respect to ethical implications. I am especially interested in model transparency and social biases within language models. I am also interested in NLP for Positive Impact and am currently partnered with gun violence researcher, Professor [Joseph Richardson, Jr.](https://aaas.umd.edu/facultyprofile/richardson-jr./joseph) at [PROGRESS](https://bsos.umd.edu/academics-research/prevent-gun-violence-research-empowerment-strategies-solutions).

I obtained my S.M. in Operations Research from MIT in 2019 and my B.S. in Operations Research and Chinese from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 2017. I was an Active Duty Army Officer from 2017-2025.

My full CV is available upon request.

## fun facts

I love a bit of pain with (elevation) gain: mountain biking, skiing, and trail running. But on quieter days, you can also find me playing piano, reading, and gardening.
